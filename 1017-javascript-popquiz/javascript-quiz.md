Instructions:

- Add your answers inline to the markdown file.
- Use your own words.
- Come up with an answer from memory. Write it down, even if the answer is "I don't know."
- Then, submit all of your answers in a file to canvas. This is so Lloyd and I can get a sense of your understanding.
- Finally, we will go over the answers in class. Write down your revised answer below your original answer.

### Part 3: Algorithms - 20 minutes

7. What is an algorithm?

8. For the following problem, first write down how exactly to solve the problem in English. Once you are able to describe it in English, translate it into code.

```js
// Given an array of values, write a function that finds the index of where the value is located, and if nothing is found, returns -1.
// Do not use the indexOf function.
// example: for ['apple', 'orange', 'pineapple']
	// 'orange' returns '1'
	// 'durian' returns '-1'
```

9. Again, for the following problem, first write down how exactly to solve the problem in English. Once you are able to describe it in English, translate it into code.

```js
// Write a function that finds all the indexes of where the value is located and returns them in an array, and if nothing is found, returns -1
// example: ['apple', 'orange', 'orange', 'pineapple']
	// 'orange' returns [1,2]
```
